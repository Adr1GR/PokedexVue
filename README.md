# Pokedex and Vue 3

Simple project to learn Vue. I’m also using it to improve how I manage a project on GitHub (issues, PRs, branches).

Goal: create a Pokédex the way I like it. I’m also using Electron for the desktop port and Capacitor for the Android one.

The only rule I have is not to use AI for help—neither Copilot (which is very useful once you understand what you’re doing) nor any chatbot like ChatGPT.
